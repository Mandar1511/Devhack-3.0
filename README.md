At any point of time, there was always a large number of people who looked up into the night sky and wondered what was going on. Now, with the advancement in technology, we have a significant knowledge of what things are beyond the place where man can go. One such fascinating object that we find in outer space is an asteroid. These rocks moving in space are now an object of fascination and obsession for millions across the world. But unfortunately the data on them is too unorganised and too convoluted for anyone to understand.

Our aim was to create a website that could give a person paramount chunks of information on a particular asteroid. Asteroids are large in number and their information remains scattered across the internet. Asteroids are given unique names and SPK-ID by an organisation called the IAU. This SPK-ID helps us identify or pinpoint which asteroid a person is talking about. We have gathered all these asteroids at a single place for the user's convenience. All our website asks is the SPK-ID of the asteroid, and provides you data such as relative velocity, diameter,etc whenever the asteroid is closest to Earth. This makes it extremely easy for a person to access info about any particular asteroid all clubbed at a single place. Our website is user friendly and requires info only about the SPK-ID of the asteroid. Even a person who has less knowledge about asteroids but is fascinated by them can use the website to enhance his/her knowledge.
